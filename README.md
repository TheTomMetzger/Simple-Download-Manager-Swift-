# Simple Download Manager (Swift)
The source code for the Swift version of the Simple Download Manager from my tutorial on downloading files using a `UIWebView` (wich can be found [here](http://www.southernerd.us/blog/tutorial/2017/01/01/Download-Manager-Tutorial.html))

<br>

## What It Does
* Use `UIWebView` to browse for and download files
* The display them in a `UITableView`

<br>

## Where You Can Improve From Here
* Implement a Pull To Refresh feature on the `UITableView`
* Delete files from the `UITableView`
* Add an `UIActivityIndicatorView` to the "Downloading..." `UIAlertController`

<br>
